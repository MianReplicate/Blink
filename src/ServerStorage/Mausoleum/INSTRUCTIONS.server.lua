Hello! Thank you for wanting to help branch off my new Game "Dont Blink!"

Before making a map I suggest you read this ENTIRE Instruction Script. There
are many requirements maps must fit in order for them to work. If they Dont
fufill these requirements they will be auto-denied and all your work will have
been for nothing!

MAKE SURE ALL ELEMENTS OF THE MAP ARE IN THEIR PROPER MODEL. Dont CHANGE
ANYTHING IN THIS MODEL BESIDES THE TITLE OF YOUR MAP. YOU CAN DELETE THIS
SCRIPT ASWELL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] The Map

The requirement for the map in general is that THE MAP MUST BE 100% PITCH
BLACK WITHOUT THE USE OF DYNAMIC LIGHTS. If you want to make an outdoor map
it'll have to use fake 'Natural Lighting'. If a map is not 100% PITCH BLACK
without Dynamic Lights it will be AUTO-DENIED.

THE MAP. MUST. BE. PITCH BLACK. WITHOUT THE USE. OF. DYNAMIC LIGHTS.

Also, Make sure the map is quite 'large', by large I mean there's a lot of
different areas. You Dont want to have everyone too close together or else
rounds will go by really quick or really slow. I suggest lots of corners
and pitch black areas (But make sure there's some light!)

** The Map will be under the HUGE brick Provided **

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2] The Lights

The requirement for the lights is that each light MUST BE a PointLight. You
CAN NOT use SpotLights in this game as of now. Brightness doesn't matter, as
long as the light is Enabled it will affect the Angels. If you need to include
Fire/etc in your lights feel free to do so.

Make sure the Light Object INSIDE the Part is named 'Bulb' (Use the Example
Light I gave you! You can resize it!) and that the actual parts name is
'Light'.

REMEMBER THE PLAYERS WILL HAVE LANTERNS. Dont LIGHT UP THE WHOLE MAP!!!
DARK = GOOD

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3] The Spawns

Spawns are relatively easy, just place them where you want players/angels to
spawn into the game. Make sure there's quite a bit so there's varying areas.
For example, my basic map uses about 24 different spawns. Not enough spawns
means players are too close. We Dont want that!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4] How to Submit your Map

Name your map whatever you want to name it and include [SBM - Dont Blink]
EXACTLY AS I JUST TYPED IT in the name/description. Make sure the model is
free! If you'd like to PM me the Map or post it in the Comments/Group Wall/
Etc feel free to do so, though either way i'm going to be checking for new
maps via the catalog a lot. I Dont read my PM's as much as I'll check the
Catalog so MAKE. SURE. IT. HAS. [SBM - Dont Blink] (WITH THE BRACKETS!)

Good Luck! Any questions comment on THIS model or attempt PMing me.

-SBM
